This is a significantly revised design based around two SRAM chips, using the buffered A9 input from U34 to provide sufficient address lines. This board will give 2MB CHIP RAM in an A500+ & the trapdoor expansion will be rendered useless for any memory expansions.

This board also has seen the design optimized significantly for low z-height, meaning it shouldn't foul the keyboard in a stock A500+ case.
